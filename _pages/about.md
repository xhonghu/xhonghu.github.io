I am a fourth-year student in the Combined Master's and PhD Program from [ZHEJIANG UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY](https://www.zjut.edu.cn/), currently in the School of Computer Science and Technology. I am supervised by Professor Xu-Hua Yang. My research interests include scene graph generation, video understanding, and sign language recognition and translation.
